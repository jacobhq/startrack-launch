# What is Startrack?

Startrack is a Next.js app with dynamic pages for each repo. It acts as a GitHub oAuth app, allowing for one-click starring of repos.

- **Fast** - Startrack pages load fast for a great experience
- **Seamless** - The experience of starring a repo is frictionless
- **Simple** - All it takes is one link in your app
